"""Core options of the libretro cores, driven by the feature YAML files.

Every feature of a ``libretro_<core>.yaml`` file sets a core option, and the
choice picked in EmulationStation is written as it is, so the choice values must
be what the core expects. The option is looked up in this order (the generator of
es_features.cfg ignores these keys)::

    core_options:          # the choice sets several options (the value is a free name)
      2x: {melonds_render_mode: opengl, melonds_opengl_resolution: "2"}
    core_option: name      # the option has this name
    value: name            # otherwise the option is named like the feature

``value`` is the key EmulationStation stores for the game, so it must be unique
among the cores of a system: write ``core_option`` only when the two names
differ (two cores share an option name with other values, or the name has
characters the settings file cannot keep). An empty ``core_option`` is the same
as none. ``core_option: false`` says it is not a core option: other launcher
code reads that feature.

A feature can also set a setting of retroarch.cfg instead, the same way (the
choice is written as it is)::

    retroarch_option: input_libretro_device_p1    # a controller device, for example

A game that leaves the feature unset (or on ``auto``) gets the core default:
the options the feature manages are removed from the core options file, so a
value picked for another game never leaks into this one.
