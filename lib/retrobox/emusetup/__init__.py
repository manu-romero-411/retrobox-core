"""Full-screen screen that runs an installer and shows its output.

The launcher runs it (``python3 -m retrobox.emusetup``) in its own process
when the emulator a game needs is not installed, so none of its memory
(SDL, Pillow, fonts, the background) stays behind while the game runs. The
startup runs it too, with ``--download``, while it downloads the default
theme or bezels before EmulationStation starts.

* ``launch``: what the callers use to run it (arguments, exit statuses).

* ``app``: the window, its states and its event loop.
* ``terminal``: the scrollback of the installer output (wrapping, selection).
* ``process``: the installer child process and its output thread.
* ``pad``: player 1's gamepad, mapped as in EmulationStation.

Exit status: 0 installed (launch the game), 10 declined (or download
cancelled), 11 install failed, 12 no screen could be opened.
